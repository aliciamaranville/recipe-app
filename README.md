File location: aliciamaranville/projects.nosync/this is where the folder goes

Open recipe-app in vs code
Open xCode simulator
Select whatever phone you are using on the simulator as your target device in the bottom right corner of vs code
Go to the main.dart file
Click 'Run and Debug' which will build the code and open the app in the simulator
You can make changes to the code then refresh to automatically update the simulator without rebuilding every time

Create projects.nosync folder

Has to be this way for some iCloud purpose I am not sure exactly

File location: aliciamaranville/projects.nosync/this is where the folder goes

You have to create a projects.nosync folder

Has to be this way for some iCloud purpose I am not sure exactly

1. Open recipe-app in vs code

2. Open xCode simulator

3. Select whatever phone you are using on the simulator as your target device in the bottom right corner of vs code

4. Go to the main.dart file

5. Click 'Run and Debug' which will build the code and open the app in the simulator

6. You can make changes to the code then refresh to automatically update the simulator without rebuilding every time
